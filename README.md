# cifuzz

> **_IMPORTANT:_** This project is under active development. 
Be aware that the behavior of the commands or the configuration 
can change.

**cifuzz** is a CLI tool that helps you to integrate and run fuzzing 
based tests into your project.

## Getting started
If you are new to the world of fuzzing, we recommend you to take a 
look at our [Glossary](docs/Glossary.md).

### Installation

#### Building from Source (Linux)

**Prerequisites**
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [CMake >= 3.16](https://cmake.org/)
* [LLVM >= 11](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)
* [go >= 1.18](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* [libcap](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/libcap.3.html)


**Ubuntu / Debian**
<!-- when changing this, please make sure it is in sync with the E2E pipeline -->
```bash
sudo apt install git make cmake clang llvm golang-go libcap-dev 
```

**Arch**
<!-- when changing this, please make sure it is in sync with the E2E pipeline -->
```bash
sudo pacman -S git make cmake clang llvm go libcap
```

To build **cifuzz** from source you have to execute the following steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/cifuzz.git
cd cifuzz
make test
make install
```
If everything went fine, you will find the newly created directory 
`~/cifuzz`. Do not forget to add `~/cifuzz/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To verify the installation we recommend you to start a fuzzing run
in one of our example projects:
``` bash
cd examples/cmake
cifuzz run my_fuzz_test
```
This should stop after a few seconds with an actual finding.

### Setup / Create your first fuzz test

**cifuzz** commands will interactively guide you through the needed 
options and show next steps. You can find a complete 
list of the available commands with all supported options and 
parameters by calling `cifuzz command --help` or 
[here](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/cifuzz/wiki/cifuzz).

1. To initialize your project with cifuzz just execute `cifuzz init` 
in the root directory of your project. This will create a file named 
`cifuzz.yaml` containing the needed configuration.

2. The next step is to create a fuzz test. Execute `cifuzz create` 
and follow the instructions given by the command. This will create a 
stub for your fuzz test, lets say it is called `my_fuzz_test.cpp`.

3. Edit `my_fuzz_test.cpp` so it actually calls the function you want 
to test with the input generated by the fuzzer. To learn more about 
writing fuzz tests you can take a look at our 
[Tutorial](docs/How-To-Write-A-Fuzz-Test.md) or one of the 
[example projects](examples).

4. Start the fuzzing by executing `cifuzz run my_fuzz_test`. 
**cifuzz** now tries to build the fuzz test and starts a fuzzing run.

### Regression testing

**Important:** In general there are two ways to run your fuzz test:

1. An actual fuzzing run by calling: `cifuzz run my_fuzz_test`.
The fuzzer will rapidly generate new inputs and feed them into your 
fuzz test. Any input that covers new parts of the fuzzed project will 
be added to the generated corpus. cifuzz will run until a crash occurs 
and report detailed information about the finding.

2. As a regression test, by invoking it through your IDE/editor or by
directly executing the replayer binary 
(see [here](docs/How-To-Write-A-Fuzz-Test.md#how-to-buildcompile-your-fuzz-tests)
on how to build that binary).
This will use the replayer to apply existing input data from the
seed corpus. In this case the fuzz test will stop immediately after
applying all input or earlier if a regression occurs.
